			<p>as i was star searching last night something caught my eye that i haven't seen before. it was a small rectangular box floating by the guestbook planet. i got into my spaceship to get a closer look.</p>
			<p>upon arrival i sent out my space robot to retrieve the box and bring it into my ship. i was eager to see what awaited me in the airlook.</p>
			<p>wow! it was dusty, but it's a old radio. i haven't seen one of these in a while. it looks like it can pick up just one station. i'm not sure where the signal is coming from, but it's somewhere in this galaxy. i love a good pirate radio broadcast.</p>
			<p>i'll just place it down by the galaxy map and enjoy the lo-fi sounds.</p>
